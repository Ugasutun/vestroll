# VestRoll: Payroll

VestRoll is a payroll and invoicing platform built for the 2026 financial ecosystem. Built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, and the **Stellar Soroban** stack, it offers a "No-Crypto" UX where privacy, speed, and biometric security are standard.

## 🏗️ The 2026 Technology Stack

### Core Architecture

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15.5](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router & Turbopack)
- **Library**: [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **State**: Redux Toolkit (UI) & Zustand (Store)

### Identity & Privacy (ZK)

- **Auth**: [@stellar/passkey-kit](https://github.com/stellar/passkey-kit) (FaceID/TouchID Biometric Login)
- **Privacy**: [Stellar Protocol 25 (X-Ray)](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/protocol-25-x-ray) & `circomlib` for ZK-shielded payroll.
- **Smart Accounts**: [@stellar/smart-account-kit](https://github.com/stellar/smart-account-kit) for automated contract-wallet deployment.

### Finance & Fiat Bridge

- **Fiat Providers**: Native integration for **Monnify** and **Flutterwave** (NGN On-ramps).
- **Stellar Bridge**: [SEP-24](https://stellar.org/developers/stellar-wallet-sdk) via Stellar Wallet SDK for automated NGN-to-USDC settlement.
- **Gasless UX**: **Launchtube** / Fee-Bumping infrastructure (Zero XLM required for users).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Invisible Onboarding**: Users sign up with Email and Biometrics (Passkeys). No seed phrases, no private keys, no 12-word recovery.
- **Hybrid Recovery**: A "Best of Both Worlds" security model—Biometric speed for daily use, Email recovery for account resets.
- **ZK-Shielded Payments**: Payroll amounts are hidden from the public ledger using Zero-Knowledge proofs, providing enterprise-grade confidentiality.
- **Automated Fiat-Stable Bridge**: Deposits in **Naira (NGN)** are automatically reflected as **USDC** in the Smart Wallet, enabling instant global payouts.
- **Atomic Batching**: Disburse 100+ payroll entries in a single biometric signature using Soroban atomic transactions.
- **Invisible Gas**: Transaction fees are sponsored (Launchtube) or paid in USDC, ensuring users never need to hold or know about XLM.
